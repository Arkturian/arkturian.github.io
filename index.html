        <section><p><strong>The goal of any journey has to be determined right at the beginning or else you wander idly as a leaf in winds. Consider carefully now: why did you take this book? You&#39;ve read a lot of other books, you have been listening to many gurus, you even might belong to a religion of some sort, and yet you&#39;re here and reading this. Inquire: why?</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is a splinter in your mind that fuels your strangeness, it does not allow you to just settle down and &quot;live a normal life&quot;. But what&#39;s the goal of this desire? What is it that this splinter wants? The only reason that could motivate you to pick up this giant brick of paper and at least imagine taking in its yearly course is very simple: you are deeply disappointed and unsatisfied. All of those books and gurus didn&#39;t work for you, as well as many other things that you have tried in &quot;normal life&quot;, but something deep in you continues striving forward refusing to give up, it looks for something so majestic that nothing is compared to that. Before you say this strive is meaningless and never could be reached, let me invite a simple question: what if the splinter&#39;s goal is happiness? Is this too much to ask?</strong></p>

<p><strong>This course is a unique and absolutely self-sustained instruction for guiding you to happiness and it requires not from you to have a background in any other system of a thought. In fact, you&#39;ll do yourself a major favor if you would drop all that you&#39;ve grasped before - those books and gurus failed you, hold on to it no more. Don&#39;t try to fit this course in well known patterns, accept the fact you need a teacher and open up your mind abroad.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If happiness is your desire but you do not abide in joy, then it is logical to figure: you must be doing something wrong. Depression, fear, anxiety are rather more familiar to you and so it follows that your current thinking framework is dedicated heavily to those. There is a saying that to get a thing you never had, you gotta do what never tried. Another quote asserts: in goodness you are asked to bite the poison and after that the honey flows, while ignorance is giving you the honey barrel, but when you bite it - poison flows.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no stamp and sign on paper, no court supported guarantee this course is genuine, but if you follow it you&#39;ll get experience and only this can ever make you sure. To sum it up, you must be ready for a challenge, because ACIM is going to disturb. You will resist against what it is asking you and yet what if behind of your resistance lays the key that&#39;s gonna make at last all of the difference in the world?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your past learning must have taught you the wrong things, simply because it has not made you happy. On this basis alone its value should be questioned. ... The curriculum of the Atonement is the opposite of the curriculum you have established for yourself, but so is its outcome. If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy, and if you want a different one, a change in the curriculum is obviously necessary. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-8.I.php">T-8.1.4</a></p>

<p>You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must first recognize that you are miserable and not happy. The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery is happiness.<a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-14.II.php">T-14.2.1</a></p>

<p>Resign now as your own teacher. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-12.V.php?dig=8">T-12.5.8</a></p>

<p>God&#39;s Will for you is perfect happiness ... You are indeed essential to God&#39;s plan. Without your joy, His joy is incomplete. Without your smile, the world cannot be saved. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.100.php">W-100.2,3</a></p>

        <section><p><strong>ACIM is not your yet another esoteric book a bunch of which you&#39;re used to read each month. A lot of things in it remain unknown to you awhile, don&#39;t try to push it, don&#39;t try to squeeze the understanding from it, but allow it to reveal itself for you instead.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The guiding rope for you to navigate this section is knowing: miracles are not some magic tricks. Behind the word &quot;a miracle&quot; the &quot;genuine forgiveness&quot; process rests. And yet this process of forgiveness is not what you may think of it for now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In swapping &quot;miracles&quot;--&quot;forgiveness&quot;, confusion goes away. The genuine forgiveness process is meant to be applied to every thing that blows your peace, from major accidents to seeming little things like unwashed dishes or just cold outside.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you maintain that there must be an order of difficulty in miracles, all you mean is that there are some things you would withhold from truth. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-17.I.php">T-17.1.3</a></p>

<p>It is not easier to forgive one sin than to forgive all of them. The illusion of orders of difficulty is an obstacle the teacher of God must learn to pass by and leave behind. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/M-14.php">M-14.3</a></p>

<p>Forgiveness is the key to happiness. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.121.php">W-121</a></p>

        <section><p><strong>This brings the light to yet another facet of the diamond which genuine forgiveness is: you practice not in it alone. Your willingness and your allowance are the key to let Divinity step in.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The seekers scroll through stacks of books and pick the things they liked from each to cook their own salvation&#39;s recipe. But if it&#39;s you who is in charge of your atonement, then why you&#39;re not enlightened still?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow the Holy Spirit&#39;s teaching in forgiveness, then, because forgiveness is His function and He knows how to fulfill it perfectly.

How many times you thought the same about mercedes or career, romantic lover, fame or children and villa on a sheer? You might have also had some reveries that drinking alcohol will do or using drugs of any kind. Dig deep in this idea: what is it that you really want? If you look good enough you&#39;ll see the only reason why you&#39;re seeking all those things -- the joy is tied to them within your mind and it is joy indeed you really want. And yet, how many times your idols failed you? Weren&#39;t you shocked by the amount of side effects they bring?

        <section><p><strong>This is a very crucial topic. Fear stands among the leaders of bad decisions&#39; motivators so when you&#39;ll grasp the depth of meaning for this subject your life will never be the same.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let us consider briefly what reasons make you scared. First and foremost you must be thinking that this event or person is absolutely real. The follow up is the idea: this situation threatens you somehow. And final step to get you frightened is to assure you that you have no control.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The combination of these reasons leads you to conclusion that you might become a victim so you need react preventively right now. This is a very nasty hook which you can dodge by realizing: all of those statements are equally untrue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Take time to learn what&#39;s in the quotes related, without this solid foundation forgiveness can&#39;t be understood.</strong></p>

<p>I thank You, Father, for Your plan to save me from the hell I made. It is not real. And You have given me the means to prove its unreality to me.

        <section><p><strong>A crucial moment here. The seekers scroll through stacks of books and pick the things they liked from each to cook their own salvation&#39;s recipe. But if it&#39;s you who is in charge of your atonement, then why you&#39;re not enlightened still?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resign now as your own teacher. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-12.V.php?dig=8">T-12.5.8</a></p>

<p>Think not that you can find salvation in your own way ... Give over every plan that you have made for your salvation in exchange for God&#39;s. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-15.IV.php">T-15.4.2</a></p>

<p>Forgiveness is the only road that leads out of disaster, past all suffering, and finally away from death. How could there be another way, when this one is the plan of God Himself?
