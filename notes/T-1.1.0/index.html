    <section>
      <p><strong>The goal of any journey has to be determined right at the beginning or else you wander idly as a leaf in winds. Consider carefully now: why did you take this book? You&#39;ve read a lot of other books, you have been listening to many gurus, you even might belong to a religion of some sort, and yet you&#39;re here and reading this. Inquire: why?</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is a splinter in your mind that fuels your strangeness, it does not allow you to just settle down and &quot;live a normal life&quot;. But what&#39;s the goal of this desire? What is it that this splinter wants? The only reason that could motivate you to pick up this giant brick of paper and at least imagine taking in its yearly course is very simple: you are deeply disappointed and unsatisfied. All of those books and gurus didn&#39;t work for you, as well as many other things that you have tried in &quot;normal life&quot;, but something deep in you continues striving forward refusing to give up, it looks for something so majestic that nothing is compared to that. Before you say this strive is meaningless and never could be reached, let me invite a simple question: what if the splinter&#39;s goal is happiness? Is this too much to ask?</strong></p>

<p><strong>This course is a unique and absolutely self-sustained instruction for guiding you to happiness and it requires not from you to have a background in any other system of a thought. In fact, you&#39;ll do yourself a major favor if you would drop all that you&#39;ve grasped before - those books and gurus failed you, hold on to it no more. Don&#39;t try to fit this course in well known patterns, accept the fact you need a teacher and open up your mind abroad.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If happiness is your desire but you do not abide in joy, then it is logical to figure: you must be doing something wrong. Depression, fear, anxiety are rather more familiar to you and so it follows that your current thinking framework is dedicated heavily to those. There is a saying that to get a thing you never had, you gotta do what never tried. Another quote asserts: in goodness you are asked to bite the poison and after that the honey flows, while ignorance is giving you the honey barrel, but when you bite it - poison flows.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no stamp and sign on paper, no court supported guarantee this course is genuine, but if you follow it you&#39;ll get experience and only this can ever make you sure. To sum it up, you must be ready for a challenge, because ACIM is going to disturb. You will resist against what it is asking you and yet what if behind of your resistance lays the key that&#39;s gonna make at last all of the difference in the world?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your past learning must have taught you the wrong things, simply because it has not made you happy. On this basis alone its value should be questioned. ... The curriculum of the Atonement is the opposite of the curriculum you have established for yourself, but so is its outcome. If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy, and if you want a different one, a change in the curriculum is obviously necessary. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-8.I.php">T-8.1.4</a></p>

<p>You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must first recognize that you are miserable and not happy. 3 The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery is happiness.<a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-14.II.php">T-14.2.1</a></p>

<p>Resign now as your own teacher. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-12.V.php?dig=8">T-12.5.8</a></p>

<p>Remember nothing that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-28.I.php">T-28.1.7</a></p>

<p>Think not that you can find salvation in your own way ... Give over every plan that you have made for your salvation in exchange for God&#39;s. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-15.IV.php">T-15.4.2</a></p>

<p>Only God&#39;s plan for salvation will work. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.71.php">W-71</a></p>

<p>I merely follow, for I would not lead. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pII.324.php">W-324</a></p>

<p>God&#39;s Will for you is perfect happiness ... You are indeed essential to God&#39;s plan. Without your joy, His joy is incomplete. Without your smile, the world cannot be saved. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.100.php">W-100.2,3</a></p>
