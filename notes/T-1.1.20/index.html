      <p>How many times you thought a heavy bank account will make you happy? How many times you thought the same about mercedes or career, romantic lover, fame or children and villa on a sheer? You might have also had some reveries that drinking alcohol will do or using drugs of any kind. Dig deep in this idea: what is it that you really want? If you look good enough you&#39;ll see the only reason why you&#39;re seeking all those things -- the joy is tied to them within your mind and it is joy indeed you really want. And yet, how many times your idols failed you? Weren&#39;t you shocked by the amount of side effects they bring? You thought a zillion coins will give you peace and happiness but what you&#39;ve got is constant worry and distress. Is it not time for you stop chasing carrots but focus on your real goal instead?</p>

<p>If you would look on anyone more closely to figure out their motivation and what exactly makes them tick, you&#39;ll be surprised to see that you are not the only one who&#39;s chasing happiness, it is at root for anyone indeed. There is no difference between a mother of a baby and user of some drug except in ways they&#39;re looking for it: the mother plans to get it from her baby the other - from the drug. Even the biggest tyrants you can name were doing what they&#39;ve done only because they honestly believed: this is the way to joy. And so the universal goal is equal but everyone has a unique and special plan on how to get it, a map their very own. However if you have dared to lift this heavy brick of paper it means you are among of those who&#39;ve started to suspect: your plan has failed.</p>

<p>what you seek for is a source of joy as you conceive it. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-24.V.php">T-24.5.1</a></p>

<p>It never is the idol that you want. But what you think it offers you <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-30.III.php?dig=offers">T-30.3.4</a></p>

<p>You must have noticed an outstanding characteristic of every end that the ego has accepted as its own. When you have achieved it, it has not satisfied you. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-8.VIII.php">T-8.8.2</a></p>

<p>It is essential that you accept the fact, and accept it gladly, that there is no form of littleness that can ever content you. You are free to try as many as you wish, but all you will be doing is to delay your homecoming. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-15.III.php">T-15.3.2</a></p>

<p>The world I see holds nothing that I want. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.128.php">W-128</a></p>

<p>Seek not outside yourself. For it will fail, and you will weep each time an idol falls. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-29.VII.php">T-29.7.1</a></p>

<p>Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs. This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-6.II.php?dig=needs">T-6.2.5</a></p>

<p>Accept the plan you did not make <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.186.php">W-186.5</a></p>

<p>Only God&#39;s plan for salvation will work. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.71.php">W-71</a></p>
