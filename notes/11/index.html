    <section><p><strong>Please do not use this statement to justify a charity of any kind. The Author speaks about the level of the Mind. When a composer shares his song with others, it hardly means: for him it&#39;s lost; the sharing makes it stronger and gives him opportunities he didn&#39;t have before. The course takes this idea and brings it to the level where you will be amazed for sure.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A major learning goal this course has set is to reverse your view of giving, so you can receive ... God&#39;s gifts will never lessen when they are given away. They but increase thereby. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.105.php">W-105</a></p>

<p>All that I give is given to myself. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.126.php">W-126</a></p>
