      <p><strong>This is a very crucial topic. Fear stands among the leaders of bad decisions&#39; motivators so when you&#39;ll grasp the depth of meaning for this subject your life will never be the same.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let us consider briefly what reasons make you scared. First and foremost you must be thinking that this event or person is absolutely real. The follow up is the idea: this situaition threatens you somehow. And final step to get you frightened is to assure you that you have no control.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The combination of these reasons leads you to conclusion you might become a victim so you need react preventively right now. This is a very nasty hook which you can dodge by realizing: all of those statements are equally untrue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Take time to learn what&#39;s in the quotes related, without this solid foundation forgiveness can&#39;t be understood.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>God did not create a meaningless world. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.14.php">W-14</a></p>

<p>I am not the victim of the world I see. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.31.php">W-31</a></p>

<p>I have invented the world I see. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.32.php">W-32</a></p>

<p>If I defend myself I am attacked. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.135.php">W-135</a></p>

<p>What if you recognized this world is an hallucination? What if you really understood YOU made it up? <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-20.VIII.php">T-20.8.7</a></p>

<p>The end of dreaming is the end of fear <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-28.III.php">T-28.3.4</a></p>

<p>I thank You, Father, for Your plan to save me from the hell I made. It is not real. And You have given me the means to prove its unreality to me. The key is in my hand, and I have reached the door beyond which lies the end of dreams. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pII.342.php">W-342.1</a></p>
