        &Prime;Specialness  is a lack of trust in anyone except yourself. faith is invested in  yourself alone.&Prime;

    <section><p><strong>Is it not, that reason of the lack of trust lies in the fact: they have already failed you in the past?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think on this, and learn the cause of faithlessness: You think you hold against your brother what he has done to you. But what you really blame him for is what you did to him. It is not his past but yours you hold against him. And you lack faith in him because of what you were. Yet you are as innocent of what you were as he is. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-17.VII.php">T-17.7.8</a></p>
