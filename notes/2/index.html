    <section><p><strong>A crucial moment here. The seekers scroll through stacks of books and pick the things they liked from each to cook their own salvation&#39;s recipe. But if it&#39;s you who is in charge of your atonement, then why you&#39;re not enlightened still?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resign now as your own teacher. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-12.V.php?dig=8">T-12.5.8</a></p>

<p>Remember nothing that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-28.I.php?dig=badly%20taught">T-28.1.7</a></p>

<p>Think not that you can find salvation in your own way ... Give over every plan that you have made for your salvation in exchange for God&#39;s. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-15.IV.php">T-15.4.2</a></p>

<p>Only God&#39;s plan for salvation will work. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.71.php">W-71</a></p>

<p>Forgiveness is the only road that leads out of disaster, past all suffering, and finally away from death. How could there be another way, when this one is the plan of God Himself? And why would you oppose it, quarrel with it, seek to find a thousand ways in which it must be wrong; a thousand other possibilities?  <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pII.198.php?dig=road">W-198.4</a></p>

<p>I merely follow, for I would not lead. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pII.324.php">W-324</a></p>
