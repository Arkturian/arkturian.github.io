      <p><strong>How many times you thought a heavy bank account will make you happy? How many times you thought the same about mercedes or career, romantic lover, fame or children and villa on a sheer? You might have also had some reveries that drinking alcohol will do or using drugs of any kind. Dig deep in this idea: what is it that you really want?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you look good enough you&#39;ll see the only reason why you&#39;re seeking all those things -- the joy is tied to them within your mind and it is joy indeed you really want. And yet, how many times your idols failed you? Weren&#39;t you shocked by the amount of side effects they bring? You thought a zillion coins will give you peace and happiness but what you&#39;ve got is constant worry and distress.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is it not time for you stop chasing carrots but focus on your real goal instead?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs. This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal. To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the world. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-6.II.php?dig=needs">T-6.2.5</a></p>

<p>It never is the idol that you want. But what you think it offers you <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/T-30.III.php?dig=offers">T-30.3.4</a></p>

<p>The world I see holds nothing that I want. <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://miraclecenter.org/a-course-in-miracles/W-pI.128.php">W-128</a></p>
